# ikth-count-v09-webpack-js-typescript-2022

#### version09: webpack / typescript / javascript

## Status

- 20220220:
  - _Succeed in using Typescript in my webpack template_
    - _But it was a bit tricky, followed webpack recommendations but it does not handle importing ts file easily & needed to use `// @ts-ignore` keyword above the imported ts file otherwise error_
    - _Also made a few configurations to the `tsconfig.json` file to get it to work how I prefer using extension modules which has recommended settings for nodejs v16_
  - _Failed in use Js router modules_
    - _Because either they were not working like I wanted it to or the module is not for years being maintained & that concerns me in the long run_
      - _iK so I think I will use my created Js router I did in previous practice version which I do like_
