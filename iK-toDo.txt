-typescript
	-recap a bit
	-create a dummy home page for the counter
		-CCC having trouble importing & exporting with typescript within webpack.

================ DONE
-check for any outdated modules & update if any

-ensure page is working & on live server (netlify)
	-master branch

-configure netlify configuration file (netlify.toml) to redirect all static routes (js router) instead of using the typical _redirects file we used before
	-you can set up your build too & etc

-install typescript & ensure all is working accordingly

- install bootstrap & sass & test

================ TODO
-typescript
	-recap a bit
	-create a dummy home page for the counter
	-practice some typescript
	-maybe create counter logic for it instead

-create three routes scaffold with any 3rd party javascript router
	- / counter page
	- /side whatever page
	- /* error page

-create layout for each route (eg. header / footer)

-create links for all routes in header component

-create counter component scaffold with display number & its three buttons (increment/decrement/reset)
	-do not worry about the logic as we will do that with redux action creators

-check up on snyk recommendations

-git commit & see netlify deploy

-README.md file
