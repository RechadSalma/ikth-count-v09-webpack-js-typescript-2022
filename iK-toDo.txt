-create three routes scaffold with any 3rd party javascript router
	- / counter page
	- /side whatever page
	- /* error page

-create layout for each route (eg. header / footer)

-create links for all routes in header component

-check up on snyk recommendations

================ WRITE IN YOUR NOTE DOC
-typescript notes
	- // @ts-ignore	=iK will ignore you .ts imports as this will error your build
	- function name () :void {...} is for function you do not want returning anything
	-const button: HTMLElement = event.target as HTMLElement;
		- event.target are type EventTarget , but if you want to use dom properties & methods such as .textContent, than you need to set event.target type as HTMLElement as shown above
		-the first HTMLElement is optional
	- HTMLElement is a type that represents all DOM node elements
		-iK ideally try to be specific if you can
	-tsconfig.json file
		- "lib": ["DOM"] 	= to use browswer window object
		-"extends": "@tsconfig/node16/tsconfig.json",	=iK use to get the recommended settings for your nodejs version you are currently using

================ NOTE TO SELF
-SKIPPED js router because modules was either not working or not being maintained which is a concern for the long run
	-iK best to use your create Js router
